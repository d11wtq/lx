Notes for the developer, not for you ;)
---------------------------------------

Inclusive States need implementing...

addInclusiveState("ST"); //Processed in order of appearance along with unspecified states
addExclusiveState("ST"); //Ordering doesn't matter since it's self-contained

When implementing, remember...

<INITIAL> is NOT the same as unspecified.

------------------------------------------

Misfits...

In lex, accessing TopState() when there's nothing on the stack produces a segfault - Lx should throw Exception.
In lex, invoking PopState() when there's nothin on the stack produces a stack underflow error - Lx should throw Exception.
In lex, specifying a non-existent state for a rule causes an error - Lx should throw Exception.

Reject() needs implementing...

REJECT causes the action to exit immediately (like an Exception) and use the next best rule.

Terminate() needs implementing...

Terminate() causes the action to exit immediately (like an Exception) and terminates the analyzer.

All states "*" can't be done with Lx syntax...

What about <*> ? // Maybe Lx.addRule(/./, Lx.$ALL);

Restart() needs implementing...

What about Restart(newInput)? //Resets the scanner, but does not reset the start condition to INITIAL

And what about running an action which matches EOF?
